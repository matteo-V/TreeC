# Birth-Death & Coalescent Trees in C++
This repository contains code necessary to simulate phylogenetic trees in C++ with newick string output under a variety of node time models. This will be useful for simulation studies as well as model adequacy assessments.
## NOTE: This Repo is under active development
Future improvements include adding functionality to simulate under models such as:
- SI/SIS/SIR trees (and their multi-type extensions).
- "Birth-Death-Shift" Trees
